## Why React?

**Note: All this point are based on my own opinion from some reference!**

**1. Reusable Component**

React implement Composition Model Patterns

- [Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
- [React Composition Patterns](https://hackernoon.com/react-composition-patterns-from-the-ground-up-8401aaad93d7)

**2. Virtual DOM**

- [Virtual DOM and Internals](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html)
- [Virtual DOM in ReactJS](https://hackernoon.com/virtual-dom-in-reactjs-43a3fdb1d130)

**3. One-way data flow (one-way binding)**

In React, data flows in one direction, from Parent to Child. This helps components to be simple and predictable.

**4. Create React element easier with JSX**

JSX is just a nice syntactic sugar over function calls that create DOM elements. JSX produces React "element"

JSX elements => React.createElement()

**5. Explicit Mutation**

**6. Great Developer Tools**

- [React Devtools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools)

**7. Just Javascript :)**

Start learning React = Learning Javascript in the right way

## How to learn React?

- **~Webpack~**
- **~Babel~**
- **React**
- **~Redux~**
- **~React-Router~**

Yeap, just React, focus on React itself. (understanding ES6 features is + )
